Battleship2022!
===============

 Background story:
------------------

In a post-pandemic world supply shortages and fear of viral contamination have pushed the world into a global pandemonium.  Supply chains have been disrupted, harbors have backlogs and shiploads of resources are upon the seas.   This is the world of Battleship2022!  Sea captains have joined together, trying to capitalize on the situation, joining together in different factions these captains are trying to control the worlds resources.  The two players represent two factions in this new war for economic power and resource control. One trying to gain wealth, the other trying just get their hands on a roll of TP and some good reading material. 

Player one has launched their fleet. Player two has been able to sneak a spy on board of the last ship. The realized they have been compromised and begins the attack by creating an explosion. However, the spy was captured and Player 1's Intel department is hacking the spy's hardware and will be able to remotely trigger Player 2's ships inoperable in 40 seconds!

Game Play:
==========

The game begins ready for Player 1 to deploy their fleet. To deploy a ship, a player must select a ship, then click anywhere on the grid. A boat can only be placed if it is entirely within the bounds of the grid and if it does not collide with another ship.

As soon the final boat is placed the Game switches into the Hotseat screen allowing player 2 to take the captainâ€™s chair and begin guessing. A guess it made by clicking on the grid. If a guess is a hit, the tile turns red to symbolize the hit, if the guess is a miss, a white dot appears to show that a guess has already been made there.

Player 2 may have an advantage of knowing where one of the boats is located, thanks to the committed and loyal spy, however time is against them as they make their guesses. Ammo is also limited, since you know, there is a global shortage of TP, good reading material and for some reason ammo.
